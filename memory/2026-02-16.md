## Session Summary
David and I set up persistent memory across sessions. He shared the HomeCareHub project he's been building.

## Key Setup
- Telegram integration live (pairing code: J3SCRNXW)
- Persistent memory files: MEMORY.md (curated) + daily memory files (logs)
- Web search: Brave API not yet configured (needs free API key)
- Security confirmed: all files local-only to David's Mac

## HomeCareHub Project (Main Focus)
**Purpose:** In-home healthcare agency staffing platform (job board + employee mgmt)

**Current Structure:**
- `/homecarehub-src/index.html` — HTML shell with React imports
- `/homecarehub-src/app.js` — Main React app (690KB)
- `/homecarehub-src/training.html` — Training module (43KB)
- `/homecarehub.html` — Full single-file version (707KB)

**Features in App:**
- Job posting with SMS notifications to qualified staff
- Employee signup/profile management
- Job interest tracking (employees express interest, admin assigns)
- Activity & SMS logging
- Training module
- Admin dashboard
- HIPAA-compliant (uses patient initials + ID numbers)

**Development Workflow:**
- Files already split for easier editing
- Don't paste large files (hits 50K token/min rate limit)
- Instead: read specific sections, edit in place, make targeted changes
- Ask for specific features to build/fix

## Known Issues/Next Steps
(None logged yet - waiting for David to specify what to work on)
